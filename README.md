## About the Project

- This project is a simple PCB for a carrier board for a a Texas Instruments [CC112X EMK](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC1120EMK-420-470) development board and an STM32 Black Pill board, interface between the two, and jumper set to jump out the STM32 and attach an external microcontroller if necessary.
